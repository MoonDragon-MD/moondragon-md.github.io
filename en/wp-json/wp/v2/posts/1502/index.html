I will assume that you have already set the drivers for your graphics card and that you have both 64bit and 32bit Vulkan libraries (libvulkan1 mesa-vulkan-drivers mesa-vulkan-drivers:i386), for Crossover you should add libopenal1:i386 , libopenal1 and if you have NVIDIA also libnvidia-gl-450:i386<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all create a 32 bit windows10 bottle, then add DXVK in Crossover directly from &#8220;install Windows Software&#8221; then select the created bottle, for wine instead go to package management and install dxvk (or if you prefer from terminal &#8220;sudo apt-get install dxvk&#8221;). Now install the game quietly but before starting it you have to open the regedit, on Crossover select the bottle, then from the menu bar, &#8220;bottle&#8221;; &#8220;Run Command&#8230;&#8221; will open a window and write us: regedit\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you have to go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\/Software\/Wine and create a Direct3D folder, then select Direct3D and right (inside) right click &#8220;create DWord&#8221; and give it the name MaxShaderModelVS give ok and you&#8217;re done (the default value zero is ok). Now you are ready to play the inserted cd, if you want to avoid the cd go to gamecopyworld and download the no-cd ENG (text and it works perfectly also on the italian version). <br> To set the resolution 1920&#215;1080 you have to open the file \\UserProfiles\\default.pft and go to the string <br> 00000003 InGame Max Fullscreen DisplayInfo <br> and edit &#8220;Width Int 1920&#8221; and &#8220;Height Int 1080&#8221;. <br> Now you can start the game and go to the settings and set the resolution to 1920, I also recommend that you put all graphic settings to the highest quality. <br> If instead you want to buy the game on Steam you can do it here: <a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/331970\/Disneys_Treasure_Planet_Battle_of_Procyon\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/331970\/Disneys_Treasure_Planet_Battle_of_Procyon\/ <\/a>and avoid all these steps (of course then you have to set the windows compatibility layer)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a mod that adds maps and more here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.moddb.com\/games\/treasure-planet-battle-at-procyon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/www.moddb.com\/games\/treasure-planet-battle-at-procyon<\/a> I hope that this guide has been enjoyed\/served to someone!!<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dusting the old computer games I found this nice game for those who are fond of sailing ships (galleons, frigates) cannons, boarding and space.
